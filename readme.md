# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code

This year I decided to do Advent of Code with Deno, and I added utils:

```crystal
 # Create part1.ts, part2.ts and start the test watcher
 # Allows for fetching the input right when it becomes available :D
 $ deno task prep

 # Submit your solution
 $ deno task solve

 # Benchmark your solution
 $ deno task benchmark

 # The parameters of these commands can be found with:
 $ deno task
```
